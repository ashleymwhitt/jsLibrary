// LITERALS *************************************************************************

// literals are literally what they say they are
// methods are the things that help us manipulate data

let days = ['mon', 'tues', 'wed']
console.log(days.toString()) //* --> mon,tues,wed

console.log(days.length) //* --> 3

//* objects have keys & values pairs ":" --> dead giveway to an object

let soup = {
    a:'ckn noodle',
    b:'tomato',
    c:'beef stew'
};

//* if you only want soup A to print for instance, do the following:
console.log(soup.a)
//* this is called dot notation. This is how we can dig through an object to get abck data we want.

//* the follwing are also examples of literals:
let car = "Honda";

let dec = 10.2;
